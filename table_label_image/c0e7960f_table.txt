Loan Facilitation Service-Direct Model and Loan Facilitation Service-Intermediary Model
Loan facilitation service fees under the direct model decreased from RMB2,545.4 million in 2021 to RMB2,044.3 million (US$296.4 million) in 2022, primarily due toa
decrease in average total borrowing cost of the borrowers; and also partially offset by an increase in the total loan amount facilitated this year compared with 2021.
Loan facilitation service fees under the intermediary model decreased from RMBO.2 million in 2021 to nil in 2022, due to the fact that all of the institutional funding
partners invested their funds in the loans facilitated under the direct model and/or the trust model, depending on their investment strategies.
Post-origination Service
Post-origination service fees increased from RMB315.6 million in 2021 to RMB372.5 million (US$54.0 million) in 2022, primarily due to the cumulative effect of
increased volume of loans facilitated during the year. Revenues from post-origination services are recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the underlying loans
as the services are being provided.
Financing Income
Financing income increased from RMB671.9 million in 2021 to RMB966.3 million (US$140.1 million) in 2022, primarily due to an increase in average loan balances
compared with 2021
Other Revenue
Other revenue increased from RMB93.4 million in 2021 to RMB179.9 million (US$26.1 million) in 2022, primarily due to an increase in referral service fee for
introducing borrowers to other platforms and an increase in technology service fees received for providing assistant technology development services.
