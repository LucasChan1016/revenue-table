Live streaming revenues. We generate live streaming revenues from the sales of in-channel virtual items used on our live streaming platforms. Users access content
on our platforms free of charge, but are charged for purchases of virtual items.

The most significant factors that directly affect our live streaming revenues include the number of our paying users and ARPU. Our management regularly monitor
these operating metrics, which are important and direct performance indicators, in managing our live streaming business and in making relevant operational and
production decisions.

@ The number of paying users. In 2022, BIGO (including Bigo Live, Likee and imo) had 3.6 million paying users for our livestreaming services. We calculate the

number of paying users during a given period as the cumulative number of registered user accounts that have purchased virtual items or other products and
services on the above-mentioned platforms at least once during the relevant period.
