Net Revenues

We have three reportable segments: (i) learning services, (ii) smart devices, and (iii) online marketing services. We identify our
reportable segments based on the organizational units used by management to monitor performance and make operating decisions. See our
consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report for additional information regarding our three reportable segments.

The following table sets forth a breakdown of our net revenues, in absolute amounts and as percentages of total net revenues, for the

Learning services. We generate the majority of the net revenues of learning services from our tutoring services. For avoidance of
doubt, we define our tutoring services to mainly include our existing online courses and digital learning contents. In 2020, 2021 and 2022, the
net revenues generated from tutoring services were RMB1,369.0 million, RMB2,271.0 million and RMB2,886.1 million (US$418.4 million),
respectively, accounting for the vast majority of the total net revenues of our learning services.

The tuition fees from the sales of our courses are initially recorded as deferred revenue and are recognized proportionally over an
average of the learning periods of different tutoring courses. The learning period of a course refers to the period during which the course is
delivered plus the estimated period following the completion of the course during which the customers view playback of the course
recordings. The learning periods of our tutoring courses mainly range from one month to twelve months. For the proceeds from the sales of
our digital learning contents, they are initially recorded as deferred revenues as well and are recognized as revenues when the performance
obligation is satisfied upon the time of delivery. As of December 31, 2020, 2021 and 2022, we had deferred revenue of RMB809.8 million,
RMB973.9 million and RMB978.6 million (US$141.9 million), respectively, from our tutoring services.

In addition to tutoring services, we also generate net revenues from other learning services which are primarily fee-based premium
services. These services mainly include: (a) the licensing of technologies and solutions, including through Youdao Smart Cloud, to business
customers and (b) sales of subscription packages to users of our online knowledge tools, such as Youdao Dictionary, that allow them to
access additional functions, content and privileges.

Smart devices. We generate net revenues from sales of smart devices, which currently mainly include Youdao Dictionary Pen and
Youdao Listening Pod. In 2020, 2021 and 2022, the net revenues generated from smart devices were RMB540.0 million, RMB980.4 million
and RMB1,256.4 million (US$182.2 million), respectively, which was primarily attributable to the significant increase in sales volume of
Youdao Dictionary Pen and Youdao Listening Pod due to its growing popularity.
