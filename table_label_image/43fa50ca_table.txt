As of December 31, 2022, we had RMB34,326.2 million (US$4,976.8 million) in cash and cash equivalents and RMB115,112.6 million (US$16,689.8 million) in short-
term investments. Our short-term investments mainly include time deposits and wealth management products in financial institutions, which are highly liquid. We believe
this level of liquidity is sufficient to successfully navigate an extended period of uncertainty. See also “Item 3. Key Information—D. Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our
Business and Industry—We face risks related to natural disasters, health epidemics and other outbreaks, most notably those related to the outbreak of COVID-19, which
could significantly disrupt our operations.”

Online marketing services and others. We provide merchants with performance-based marketing services that match product listings appearing in search or
browser results on our online marketplace. The placement and the price for such placement are determined through an online bidding system. Revenues from online
marketing services and others depend on spontaneous decisions made by the millions of merchants on our platforms based on different marketing opportunities.

Transaction services. We charge merchants fees for transaction-related services that we provide to merchants on our platform. To better serve our merchants, we
are focused on introducing them to more of our value-added services based on their transaction needs. In addition, as part of our continued efforts to improve user
experience, we reward merchants who sell high-quality products and provide superb services with preferential fee rates. Fee rates are not necessarily fixed and may vary
based on a number of factors, including the category of the goods sold, the sellers’ transaction performance, and the attribution of the consumption scenarios, among
others.

Merchandise sales. We generated a small portion of revenues from direct sales, whereby we acquired products from suppliers and sold them directly to the
customers. We have scaled down this aspect of our business.
