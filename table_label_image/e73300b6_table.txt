Invesiment in technology and talents

Our technology is critical for us to better understand our users, improve user experience, maintain a vibrant community, and
execute our commercialization strategy. Our current research and development efforts in technology are primarily focused on enhancing our
artificial intelligence technology, big data analytics capabilities, cloud technology and game development capability, which we believe are
crucial for us to develop user insights so as to provide more relevant and engaging content to our users and to improve our operating
efficiency. In addition, there is a strong demand in China’s internet industry for talented and experienced personnel. We must recruit, retain
and motivate talented employees while controlling our personnel-related expenses, including share-based compensation expenses.

Impact of COVID-19 on Our Operations and Financial Performance

The COVID-19 pandemic has had, and, together with any subsequent outbreaks driven by new variants of COVID-19, may
continue to have, a significant impact on our operations and financial results. The potential downturn brought by and the duration of the
COVID-19 pandemic may be difficult to assess or predict where actual effects will depend on many factors beyond our control. The extent to
which the COVID-19 pandemic impacts our long-term results remains uncertain, and we are closely monitoring its impact on us.

In 2020, COVID-19 had the following impacts, among other things, on our business operations, (i) lock-downs in affected regions
disrupted our supply chain, delayed our ability to timely fulfill our e-commerce orders and led to higher fulfilment expenses, (ii) increased the
volatility of our customers’ demand for our advertising services and their advertising expenditure patterns from period-to-period, (iii) increased
the volatility of the size and engagement of our active user base, and caused us to incur higher bandwidth costs, and (iv) led to delays in
production and uncertainty in scheduling of content of our licensed content providers, which in turn had a negative impact on our premium
membership subscription and the amount of advertising sponsorship received by us. Underpinned by improved advertiser sentiment, following
the effective control of the domestic outbreaks, the resumption of business activities and the gradual recovery of the general economy in
China in 2021, our advertising service and supply chain gradually recovered. Despite the resurgence of COVID-19 in certain cities in China,
our revenues from advertising increased from 2021 to 2022, which was primarily attributable to further recognition of Bilibili’s brand name in
China’s online advertising market, as well as our improved advertising efficiency.

China began to modify its COVID control policy at the end of 2022, and most of the travel restrictions and quarantine
requirements were lifted in December 2022. There remains uncertainty as to the future impact of the virus. The extent to which the COVID-19
pandemic impacts our long-term results will depend on future developments which are highly uncertain, unpredictable and beyond our control,
including the frequency, duration and extent of outbreaks of COVID-19, the appearance of new variants with different characteristics, the
effectiveness of efforts to contain or treat cases, and future governmental actions that may be taken in response to these developments, and
measures to stimulate the general economy to improve business condition especially for small businesses. See also “Item 3. Key Information
—D. Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business and Industry—We face risks related to natural disasters, health epidemics and other
outbreaks, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, which could significantly disrupt our operations.”
