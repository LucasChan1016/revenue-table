Our ability to control our costs and operating expenses.

Our results of operations depend on our ability to control our costs and operating expenses. We expect our bandwidth costs to increase as we grow our business, in
particular CDN business, although we expect such costs to be partly offset by the fact that we expect to source an increasing amount of bandwidth from our cloud
computing services. In addition, our operating expenses are expected to increase in the future, since we expect an increase in marketing expense in a competitive
environment and an increase in employee compensation to attract talents. We plan to continue to invest in research and development to maintain our technology
leadership, especially to increase our research and development expenses and sales and marketing expenses in relation to our cloud computing, subscription and live
treaming businesses.

Description of certain statement of operations items
Revenues

We derive our revenues primarily from cloud computing services and products, subscription services, and live streaming and other internet value-added services,
which consist primarily of live streaming services, online advertising services, online games and other technical services. With a view to better presenting our revenues, we
reclassified our revenues for the purpose of analysis at the beginning of 2022 by re-grouping previous four types, i.e. subscriptions, online advertising, product revenue, and
cloud computing and other internet value-added services, into three types, i.e. cloud computing, subscriptions, and live streaming and other internet value-added services.
Revenues in each of 2021 and 2020 have been retrospectively reclassified so that the numbers can be compared and analyzed. The following table sets forth the principal
components of our total revenues by amounts and percentages of our revenues for the periods presented.

Cloud computing services and products. Revenues from cloud computing services and products increased from US$64.3 million in 2020 to US$94.8 million in 2021
and further to US$119.6 million in 2022. For cloud computing services, we recognize revenue when we provide bandwidth to our customers. We started to generate
revenue from cloud computing services and products in 2015 and the revenue from cloud computing services and products in 2022 accounted for 34.9% of our total
revenues, representing an increase of 26.2% on a year-over-year basis, primarily due to our expanded service capacity and increased demand from our major customers.

Subscriptions. We introduced our subscription services in March 2009. We generate revenues from providing our users with exclusive services, such as access to
high-speed online transmission, premium acceleration or access privileges, for a time-based subscription fee. The standard subscription fee is RMB10 (US$1.5) per month
or RMB99 (US$14.6) per year, and we also offer premium subscription packages with prices at RMB15 (US$2.2) per month or RMB149 (US$22.0) per year or RMB30
(US$4.4) per month or RMB288 (US$41.4) per year to cater to subscribersâ€™ different demand for acceleration speed and user experience, which are becoming increasingly
popular among our subscribers. Our subscription revenues, as a percentage of our revenues, decreased from 45.1% in 2020 to 38.0% in 2021 and further to 29.4% in 2022.
