In addition, the exchange rates between the Renminbi and the U.S. Dollar or other foreign currencies are affected by Chinese
government policies. In particular, the value of the Renminbi is only permitted to fluctuate within a narrow and managed band against a basket
of certain foreign currencies. The Chinese government continues to receive significant international pressure to liberalize its currency policy.
Most of our revenue is denominated in Renminbi, and most of our purchase of crude oil and some equipment and repayment of certain
borrowings are made in foreign currencies. Historically, the trend for appreciation of the Renminbi was helpful to us since our imported crude
oil purchases constitute such a large portion of our total costs. However, the recent depreciation of the Renminbi increased our costs and
affected our capacity of making profits. In addition, any depreciation of the Renminbi could adversely affect the value of the dividends of our H
Shares and ADSs, which we pay in foreign currencies.

Further appreciation in the value of Renminbi against foreign currencies (including the U.S. Dollar) may cause a decrease in the
value of our cash and cash equivalents that are denominated in foreign currencies.
