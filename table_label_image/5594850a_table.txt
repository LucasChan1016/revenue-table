IoT PaaS. We generate IoT PaaS revenue mainly from the fees charged to customers based on the number of IoT PaaS products we deploy.

Smart device distribution. We generate revenue from sales to select customers on an on-demand basis of finished smart devices with IoT PaaS deployed and sourced
from qualified OEMs. We strategically position smart device distribution as a way to nurture long-term customer relationships and have historically operated it at a
relatively moderate scale. As a result, the differences in the revenues from smart distribution services between historical periods have been primarily due to varying timing
and amounts of the customersâ€™ demands and purchases.

SaaS and others. We generate our SaaS and others revenue mainly from (i) the subscription fees charged to customers of Industry SaaS, and (ii) the fees that we
receive for certain value-added services we offer to brands and OEMs, such as Al-powered virtual assistants, and cloud-based services we offer directly to end users of
Tuya-powered smart devices, and for projects such as Cube smart private cloud solution deployment.

Cost of Revenue

Our cost of revenue consists of the costs directly related to providing our products to our customers. These costs and expenses primarily include (i) material costs,
primarily including the costs relating to the modules where the edge capabilities of loT PaaS are embedded; (ii) third-party cloud infrastructure expenses; (iii) employee-
related costs, including payroll of production support personnel; and (iv) others, including estimated warranty costs and inventory write-downs, among other things.

and product mix, among other things.
