On the other hand, the pandemic has been gradually accelerating cloud adoption as: (i) during the pandemic, people increasingly leverage the internet to fulfill daily
activities from work, shopping, education to entertainment, which are increasingly supported by cloud infrastructure; (ii) the healthcare industry in China increasingly tap
into cloud technology to meet the challenges of public health events; and (iii) enterprises and organizations experiencing business or operation fluctuations in the pandemic
may consider cloud services to obtain more efficacies, better agility and cost control in the mid-to-long run. To embrace these opportunities and mitigate the pandemic’s
adverse impact to our business, we have been continuously perfecting our scalable core technologies and products and investing into our solutions of selected verticals,
especially in healthcare, financial services and public services, and we expect to bear fruit in the enormous digitalization market in the long run.

In addition, the pandemic has adversely affected the growth of our customers, especially in the internet sector. Some of our customers have been cutting budgets,
including budgets for cloud services, to manage their profitability amid the market headwinds. Nonetheless, we are able to mitigate such adverse impacts with our
positioning and strategies: first, our customers are enterprises, rather than individual consumers, therefore we are not directly impacted by the slowdown of consumer
demand; moreover, to mitigate the risks associated with fluctuations in enterprises’ demand for our services due to adverse macroeconomic conditions affecting these
enterprises, we have begun to strategically focus on verticals with great potential for cloud services, particularly financial services, healthcare and public service sectors.

However, the extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our operational and financial performance, including our ability to execute our business strategies and
initiatives, will depend on future developments, including, but not limited to, the duration and spread of the pandemic, its severity, any resurgence of COVID-19, such as
the resurgence of COVID-19 in China in 2022, and the duration, timing and severity of the impact on customer spending, including any recession resulting from the
pandemic, all of which are uncertain and cannot be predicted. See “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Our Business and Industry—Our business is subject to natural disasters,
extreme weather conditions, health epidemics and other catastrophic incidents, and to interruption by man-made problems such as power disruptions, computer viruses,
data security breaches or terrorism.”
