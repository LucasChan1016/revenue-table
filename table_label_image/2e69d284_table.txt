Additionally, capital markets worldwide may remain volatile or increase in volatility in the coming year due to continued tightening of monetary policy by central banks, increased market interest rates, the prospect or perception
of recession or inflation, geopolitical factors such as the war in Ukraine, and other macroeconomic factors. These factors may have a negative impact on the financial position of our customers, which could decrease trading
volume and negatively impact demand for our services and, consequently, our commissions, but they may also represent opportunities for us to increase our interest income.

Commissions
We earn commissions from the brokerage services we deliver for customers’ fully disclosed accounts and consolidated accounts. See Item 4.B “Business Overview-Our Core Products and Services-Brokerage Services-Types
of Accounts.” We charge commission fees based on the amount of transaction volume, or the number of shares, lots or contracts in each order, which generally vary in accordance with the type of products or services, timing
of account activation, eligibility for discounts and other factors. In 2020, 2021 and 2022, the average rate of commissions over trading volume was 0.0354%, 0.0364% and 0.0335%, respectively, which is the ratio of the total
commissions to the total trading volume in the same period. The gradual increase in the average commission rates was primarily caused by our product diversification as the portion of higher commission product increased in
the year 2021 and the average commission rates decrease between 2021 and 2022 was primarily due to the lower commissions resulting from the decreased trading volume in 2022.
Pursuant to the agreement with our primary clearing agent, Interactive Brokers, we receive a portion of commission fees paid by our customers every time Interactive Brokers executes and clears a trade order. For
consolidated accounts, we receive commissions from customers and pay the execution and clearing fees to our clearing agents. For fully disclosed accounts, every time Interactive Brokers executes and clears a trade, it
collects the commissions, deducts a certain portion as execution and clearing fees and returns the rest of the commissions to us.
Financing service fees
Financing service fees include fees Interactive Brokers paid to us regarding the margin financing and securities borrowing and lending activities provided by Interactive Brokers to our fully disclosed account customers for
