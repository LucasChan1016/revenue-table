Our Ability to Manage Our Mix of Product and Service Offerings

Our results of operations are also affected by the mix of products and services we offer. We currently derive our revenues primarily from the sale and distribution of
pharmaceutical and other health and wellness products to our pharmacy customers and consumers. We also earn commissions and service fees from marketplace sellers on
our online marketplace. Different products and services have different cost structures. For example, the various services we provide generally have higher fixed costs. The
revenue contributions from our online direct sales model, our online marketplace model and our services have a major influence on our profitability. We intend to better
manage the mix of our product and service offerings in order to improve our profitability.

Our Ability to Control Operating Costs and Expenses and Improve Efficiency

Our cost of products sold represents primarily the purchase price of products and inbound shipping charges if any, as well as inventory write-downs. As our business
further grows in scale, we expect to obtain more favorable terms from suppliers, including pricing terms, credit period and volume-based rebates. In addition, we aim to
create value for our suppliers, especially pharmaceutical companies, by providing an effective and transparent channel for selling large volumes of their products online
and by offering them valuable data insights on market demand, customer preferences and supply chain information. We believe this value proposition will also help us
deepen our relationships with suppliers, obtain favorable terms and reduce our procurement costs. Our selling and marketing expenses are a significant contributor to our
operating costs and expenses, and they primary consist of payroll, bonus and employee benefits of sales and marketing staff, advertising costs, agency fees and costs for
promotional materials. In 2020, 2021 and 2022, selling and marketing expenses amounted to 4.9%, 4.1% and 3.4% of our total net revenues, respectively. We expect our
selling and marketing expenses to remain substantial in absolute terms as we implement new business initiatives, such as deploying additional sales personnel to promote
our 1 Pharmacy and our value-added services to pharmacies. As our business grows, we anticipate that our fulfillment expenses will increase in absolute terms in the
foreseeable future in light of our anticipated expansion and investment plans.

We continuously seek to streamline our operations and improve our supply chain and inventory management. Controlling costs and operating expenses to achieve
optimal operating efficiency is important to our success. As our business grows in scale, we expect to have significant operating leverage and realize structural cost
savings.

Product revenues. We historically reported our product revenues under our direct sales model from two reportable segments: the B2C segment and the B2B segment.
Product revenues from our B2C segment are generated from the sale of pharmaceutical and other health and wellness products through 1 Medicine Marketplace, mobile
apps, other online channels and offline pharmacies to consumers and certain enterprise customers. We also generate product revenues from the B2B segment through the
sale of pharmaceutical products to pharmacies on 1 Pharmacy.
