Effective as of the second quarter of 2022, we implemented certain changes to align segment financial reporting more closely with the manner in which our
management currently receives and uses financial information to allocate resources and evaluate the performance of reporting segments. We renamed our “online game
services” segment as “games and related value-added services,” and transferred certain business lines that are related or ancillary to games from “innovative businesses
and others” to “games and related value-added services,” including the NetEase CC live streaming service (a platform offering various live streaming content with a
primary focus on game broadcasting) and other value-added services. We retrospectively recast prior periods’ segment information to conform to current period
presentation.

We generate our revenues from the provision of games and related value-added services, Youdao, Cloud Music and other innovative businesses and others. No
customer individually accounted for greater than 10% of our total revenues for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2021 and 2022.

Games and Related Value-added Services

We generate our mobile game revenues primarily from the sale of in-game virtual items, including avatars, skills, privileges or other in-game consumables, features
or functionalities, within the games. We distribute our mobile games through partnerships with major Android- and iOS-based app stores as well as proprietary distribution
channels, such as our mobile apps and websites. Users have a variety of payment options for in-game virtual items, including using prepaid points or by making online
payments through app stores and other online payment channels. Our mobile game portfolio now consists of over 100 diverse games, and we expect to continue introducing
new mobile games each year for the foreseeable future, which we believe will contribute to future growth in net revenues from this segment.

We generate revenues from our PC games mainly through sales of prepaid points. Customers can purchase prepaid points on our NetEase online platforms through
debit or credit cards or online payment platforms through which players can directly credit points to their accounts. Customers also can purchase virtual or physical point
cards through our third-party retailers. Customers can use the points to play our PC games, either to pay for playing time or to purchase virtual items within the games,
and use our other fee-based services.

We also generate revenue from services which are related or ancillary to the operation of our games such as the NetEase CC live streaming service (a platform
offering various live streaming content with a primary focus on game broadcasting) and other value-added services.
