China began to modify its zero-COVID policy at the end of 2022, and most of the travel restrictions and quarantine requirements were lifted in December. There
were surges of cases in many cities during this time which caused temporary closure of certain brokerage stores on our platform, and there remains uncertainty as to the
future impact of the virus, especially in light of this change in policy. The extent to which the pandemic impacts our results of operations going forward will depend on
future developments which are highly uncertain and unpredictable, including the frequency, duration and extent of outbreaks of COVID-19, the appearance of new variants
with different characteristics, the success or failure of efforts to contain or treat cases, and future actions we or the authorities may take in response to these
developments. China may experience lower domestic consumption, higher unemployment, severe disruptions to exporting of goods to other countries and greater economic
uncertainty, which may impact our business in a materially negative way as our business depends substantially on the general economic conditions and the general demand
for residential real estate in China. Our business partners will need time to recover from the economic effects of the pandemic even after business conditions begin to
return to normal. Consequently, the COVID-19 pandemic may continue to materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations in the
current and future years. See also “Item 3. Key Information—D. Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business and Industry—Our business may continue to be materially and
adversely affected by the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic in China.”

Cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash, and short-term investments constitute our most liquid assets. Short-term investments include bank time deposit and
investments in wealth management products issued by financial institutions. As of December 31, 2022, we had cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and short-term
investments of RMB61.1 billion (US$8.9 billion). We believe that this level of liquidity is sufficient to successfully navigate an extended period of uncertainty.
