Table of Contents

We endeavor to constantly reinforce our monetization capabilities by providing broader and better content and services, which improves our user and customer experience,
attracts more traffic and enhances stickiness. Our robust customer and user base, in turn, leads to increased revenue and profit which enables us to further devote more
resources to content and service offerings. We intend to meet our customers’ needs throughout their lifecycle and seek additional cross-selling opportunities to achieve
synergies among our services.

Seasonality

We experience seasonality in our business, primarily our online advertising services. Advertising and marketing activities tend to be less active during the first quarter,
which is Chinese New Year holiday season. During this period, companies generally limit their advertising and marketing spending. As a result, we generally experience fewer
activities on our platform and demands for our services during the first quarter. As compared to the first quarter, our online advertising services customers tend to increase
advertising and marketing spending near the end of each calendar year. We believe an increase in revenues during the fourth quarter of each year is a typical pattern in the
online advertising market. Moreover, as most of our online/offline events are hosted in the fourth quarter of each year, we also experience an increase in revenues during the
fourth quarter of each year for our enterprise value-added services. In line with increased revenues during the fourth quarter, we record higher balances of account receivables
at year-end. See “Item 3. Key Information—3.D. Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business and Industry—Our quarterly operating results may fluctuate, which makes our
results of operations difficult to predict and may cause our quarterly results of operations to fall short of expectations.”’
