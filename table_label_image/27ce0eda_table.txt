Key Components of Results of Operations
Net revenues

In 2020 and 2021, we derived the vast majority of our net revenues from the course fees that we
charge for our large-class after-school tutoring courses. In 2022, due to the cessation of the Company's
online K-12 tutoring services by the end of 2021 in order to be compliant with the PRC regulations, we
derived all of our net revenues from teaching and learning SaaS offerings and our other educational products
and services. The following table sets forth a breakdown of our total net revenues by amounts and
percentages for the periods presented:

Our online K-12 tutoring services contributed 94.1% and 97.4%, respectively, of our total revenues
in 2020 and 2021. In compliance with the latest PRC regulations, which prohibit the provision of tutoring
services relating to academic subjects to K-12 students, we ceased offering the K-12 Academic AST
Services by the end of December 2021. This has materially and adversely affected and will materially and
adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations in 2022 and subsequent periods.

In 2022, we derived all of our net revenues from teaching and learning SaaS offerings and our other
educational products and services. The majority of our net revenue in 2022 came from our other educational
products and services, which in 2022 consisted primarily of our personalized self-directed learning product.
The larger revenue share of our other educational products and services was a result of the relatively faster
ramp-up of our student-facing products and services given our large accumulated user base. Our teaching
and learning SaaS offerings has taken a longer time to ramp-up in scale given its different user base and
longer business cycle. However, we expect our teaching and learning SaaS offerings to become an
increasingly important source of our net revenue going forward, given the significant market potential and
the strength of our offerings.

Net revenues from other educational products and services in 2020 and 2021 primarily consisted of
the subscription fees we charged for our membership-based premium educational content, with subscription
periods ranging from 15 days to one year. In 2022, a majority of our net revenues from other educational
products and services came from our personalized self-directed learning product and the remaining from
subscription fees for our membership-based premium educational content.

Cost of revenues

Our cost of revenues primarily consists of compensation costs, educational products and materials
and others. We expect our cost of revenues to decrease in absolute amounts in the foreseeable future due to
our continuous cost optimization.
