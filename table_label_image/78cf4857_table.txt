revenue for others for years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 have been retrospectively re-classified.

Advertising. We generate revenue from advertising services. Our advertising revenue is primarily driven by our MAUs and advertising revenue per MAU. We
experienced fluctuation in our advertising revenue in 2022 primarily due to the challenging macroeconomic environment in China, which negatively impacted the spending
power of our business customers.

Our advertisers are generally attracted by, among other things, the expanding user base, high-quality user profiles, and the content generated in our community.
They typically select target audience based on user profiles and review performance indices instead of specifying target content category or monitoring other similar
metrics. We do not believe that we have concentration in terms of user profiles. The pricing of our advertising is determined based on our internal marked price guidelines
that are updated from time to time. The guidelines generally take into consideration factors including, among other things, nature and type of advertisers, products and
services to be marketed, prior relationships, level of comparable demands, and scale of orders, and are implemented based on marked price for our advertising services.

Paid Membership. We generate substantially all of our paid membership revenue from Yan Selection membership fees. The following table sets forth our average
MAUs, average monthly subscribing members, and paying ratio for the periods indicated.

For the Year Ended December 31,
2019-2021
2020 2021 2022 CAGR
Average MAUs (in millions) 68.5 95.9 101.3 21.6 %
Average monthly subscribing members (in thousands) 2,362.6 5,076.0 9,806.9 103.7 %
Paying ratio 3.4 5.3 9.7 68.9 %

We formally launched our Yan Selection membership program in March 2019, and since then have continued to enhance the volume and quality of our premium
content. The increase in paid membership revenue during the periods primarily reflected the continued increases in our MAUs as well as the paying ratio. In particular, the
continued increase in paying ratio reflects the wider acceptance of the paid membership among our community.

Content-Commerce Solutions. We generate content-commerce solutions revenue primarily from service fees from our Zhi+ solutions. We formally launched our
content-commerce solutions in early 2020. The content-commerce solutions have demonstrated strong growth momentum since the launch. Our revenue from content-
commerce solutions increased from RMB135.8 million in 2020 to RMB974.0 million in 2021, and further to RMB1,030.2 million (US$149.4 million) in 2022, primarily driven
by the increasing number of our MAUs and average content-commerce solutions revenue per MAU.
