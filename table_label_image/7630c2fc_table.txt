The Group considers the ultimate beneficiary of its online advertising services as an “advertiser,” meaning the party whose products, brand awareness or marketing
activities benefited from the execution of advertisement. The Group considers a party that it enters into an advertisement service contract with as its “customer” from
accounting perspective. As such, the Group treats an advertising agency who enters into an advertisement service contract with it as a customer, and such advertising
agency may represent and serve multiple advertisers. If an advertiser directly enters into an advertisement service contract with the Group, it will treat such advertiser also
as a customer.

Revenue disaggregated by revenue source for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2021 and 2022 consists of the following:

The Group enters into contracts with its customers, which may give rise to contract assets (unbilled revenue) or contract liabilities (deferred revenue). The payment
terms and conditions within the Group’s contracts vary by the type and location of its customers and products or services purchased, the substantial majority of which are
due in less than one year. Deferred revenues related to unsatisfied performance obligations at the end of the period are mainly from the customer advance of the
advertising and marketing services and the sales of the fee-based services, such as membership, live streaming, and virtual currency or in-game virtual items sold for game
related services. The deferred revenues are recognized based on customers’ consumption or amortized on a straight-line basis through the service period for different
products/services. Due to the generally short-term duration of the contracts, the majority of the performance obligations are satisfied in the following reporting period. The
amount of revenue recognized that was included in the deferred revenue balance at the beginning of the period was US$91.5 million, US$126.5 million and US$56.1 million
for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2021 and 2022, respectively.

Practical Expedients and Exemptions

The Group generally expenses sales commissions when incurred because the amortization period is generally one year or less. These costs are recorded within sales
and marketing expenses.
Advertising and marketing revenues

Advertising and marketing revenues are derived principally from online advertising, including social display ads and promoted marketing. Social display ad
arrangements allow customers to place advertisements on particular areas of the Group’s platform or website in particular formats and over particular periods of time,
which is typically no more than three months. The Group enters into cost per mille (“CPM”), or cost per thousand impressions, advertising arrangements with the
customers, under which the Group recognizes revenues based on the number of times that the advertisement has been displayed. The Group also enters into cost per day
(“CPD”) advertising arrangements with customers, under which the Group recognizes revenues ratably over the contract periods. Promoted marketing arrangements are
primarily priced based on CPM. Under the CPM model, customers are obligated to pay when the advertisement is displayed.

The Group’s majority revenue transactions are based on standard business terms and conditions, which are recognized net of agency rebates. The agency rebates
are accounted for as variable consideration and are estimated during interim periods based on estimated annual revenue volume of each individual agent with reference to
their historical results, which involves accounting judgment. The Group believes its estimation approach in variable consideration results in revenue recognition in a
manner consistent with the underlying economics of the transaction.
