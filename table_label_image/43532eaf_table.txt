Commissions
We earn commissions from our (i) insurance brokerage services, (ii) securities and futures brokerage services (including commissions from TRS trading services) and (iii) CFD trading services when we act as market maker. We
receive commissions from the insurance companies based on a percentage of the premium paid by insurance purchasers. Unlike commissions from insurance brokerage services, we charge securities brokerage commissions
and market making commissions based on amount of transaction volume, or the number of shares, lots of contracts executed in each order, which generally vary in accordance with the type of products or services we offer,
eligibility for discounts and other factors. See “Business — Our Business Lines”.
Trading gains/(losses)
Trading gains, offset by losses, are derived as showed in the following table. The line of CFD trading gains/(losses) is derived from (i) our managed flow portfolio trading positions where we act as counterparty to our clients’
trades from our CFD trading services, and (ii) our dealing bid/offer spreads on our clients’ CFD transactions. The line of TRS trading gains/(losses) is derived from our proprietary TRS trading activities on our own accounts. The
