We divide loans facilitated on our platform into two categories, namely credit-driven services and platform services.

In providing credit-driven services, we either fund on-balance sheet loans or provide guarantee to financial institution partners for off-balance sheet loans through
the VIEs with financing guarantee license or third-party guarantee companies or insurance companies. Consequently, we take credit risk because of the on-balance sheet
lending or the guarantee arrangement. By revenue nature, revenue from facilitation and post-facilitation services for such off-balance sheet loans is recorded as loan
facilitation and servicing fees-capital heavy, revenue from guarantee services provided to financial institution partners for such off-balance sheet loans is recorded as
revenue from releasing of guarantee liabilities, and revenue from our on-balance sheet lending is recorded as financing income.

On the other hand, in providing platform services, we provide customized technology solutions at different stages of the loan lifecycle, such as borrower acquisition,
credit assessment, fund matching and post-facilitation services. Specifically, we (i) provide to financial institutions comprehensive facilitation and post-facilitation services
under the capital-light model, and charge them service fees based on pre-negotiated terms, which service fees are recorded as loan facilitation and servicing fees - capital
light; (ii) provide intelligent marketing services to financial institutions under ICE and earn pre-negotiated service fees, which are recorded under referral service fees; (iii)
provide referral services to other online lending companies and earn referral fees, which are recorded under referral service fees; and (iv) offer financial institutions risk
management SaaS and take technology service fees or consulting fees for the corresponding technology solutions elected by the financial institutions, which service fees
are recorded under other services fees, and as such service was introduced in 2020, it contributed a small fraction to our total net revenue in 2020, 2021 and 2022. We
currently do not take credit risk under platform services.
