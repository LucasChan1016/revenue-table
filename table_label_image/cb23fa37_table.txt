Since the second half of 2020 and up to the end of 2022, many of the preventive measures to counter the spread of COVID-19 imposed by local governments have been relaxed and re-imposed from time to time as
the pandemic eased temporarily and the new variants emerged. As a result, opportunities for discretionary consumption was limited and the results of our operations fluctuated during the period. In particular, the release of the
pent-up demand due to the amelioration of COVID-19 from the second half of 2020 to the first half of 2021 led to us recording a higher total net revenue in the first half of 2021 compared to that in 2020 and 2019, respectively.
However, the spread of the new variants of COVID-19 such as Delta and Omicron variants resulted in the overall weakening consumer sentiment and purchasing activities and reduced foot traffic at our offline retail stores,
which together adversely impacted our sales through our offline retail stores since the second half of 2021 and negatively impacted our total net revenues in the second half of 2021 and through 2022. Overall, our total net
revenues for the full year of 2021 increased by 11.6% to RMB5.84 billion from RMB5.23 billion in the prior year, and our total net revenues for the full year of 2022 decreased by 36.5% to RMB3.71 billion (US$537.3 million)
from RMB5.84 billion in 2021. In addition, our online sales volume over the same period fluctuated due to the unavailability of, or delays in, delivery services during such period. In terms of our supply and inventory
management, while our ODM/OEM and packaging supply partners and other service partners had to operate at reduced capacity during such period, we were able to maintain sufficient levels of inventory and fulfilment
capacity through our self-operated warehouses.

China began to modify its zero-COVID policy at the end of 2022, and most of the travel restrictions and quarantine requirements were lifted in December. There were surges of cases in many cities during this time
which caused disruption to our and our suppliers and logistics providers’ operations, and there remains uncertainty as to the future impact of the virus, especially in light of this change in policy. The extent to which the
pandemic impacts our results of operations going forward will depend on future developments which are highly uncertain and unpredictable, including the frequency, duration and extent of outbreaks of COVID-19, the
appearance of new variants with different characteristics, the effectiveness of efforts to contain or treat cases, and future actions that may be taken in response to these developments. China may experience lower domestic
consumption, higher unemployment, severe disruptions to exporting of goods to other countries and greater economic uncertainty, which may impact our business in a materially negative way as consumer sentiment may
continue to remain low. Consequently, the COVID-19 pandemic may continue to materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations in the current and future years. See “Item 3. Key
Information—D. Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Our Business and Industry—Our operations have been, and may continue to be affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.”

Key Components of Results of Operations
Net revenues

Our net revenues are net of refunds and value-added tax. Due to operational changes, we adjusted the reporting segmentation from one reportable segment to three reportable segments on a product category basis
in light of the development of our Skincare Brands business. Our net revenues are primarily generated from selling our beauty products and comprise net revenues from Color Cosmetics Brands, Skincare Brands and others.
The following table sets forth the breakdown of our net revenues by segment both in absolute amounts and as a proportion of our total net revenues for the years presented:
