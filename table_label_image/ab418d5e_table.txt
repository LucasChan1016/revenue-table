(1) We define M3+ Net Charge-off, with respect to loans facilitated during a specified time period, which we refer to as a vintage, as the difference between (i) the total
balance of outstanding principal of loans that become over three months delinquent during a specified period and (ii) the total amount of recovered past due payments
of principal and accrued interest in the same period with respect to all loans in the same vintage that have ever become over three months delinquent.
(2) We define M3+ Net Charge-off Rate, with respect to loans facilitated during a specified time period, which we refer to as a vintage, as the M3+ Net Charge-off divided
by the total initial principal of the loans facilitated in such vintage.

Our business and financial performance depend on our ability to manage and forecast net charge-off rates. However, given our limited operating history, we have
limited information on historical charge-off rates, and as a result, we may not be able to conduct an accurate charge-off forecast for our target borrower group. In addition,
due to the uncertainty of industry regulations, we expect borrower credit performance may be volatile in the foreseeable future, which may lead to higher default rates and
adverse impacts on our reputation, business, results of operations and financial position. See “Item 4. Information on the Company—B. Business Overview—Risk
Management.”
