Same-hotel RevPAR change. Our overall RevPAR trend does not reflect the trend of a stable and mature portfolio, because it may fluctuate when city mix and mix of
mature and ramp-up hotels change. We track same-hotel year-over-year RevPAR change for legacy Huazhuâ€™s hotels in operation for at least 18 months to monitor the
RevPAR trend for our mature hotels on a comparable basis. The following table sets forth our same-hotel RevPAR for hotels in operation under legacy Huazhu (excluding
hotels under temporary requisition) for at least 18 months for the periods indicated.

(1) In calculating the same-hotel RevPAR change (as a percentage) of our mature hotels in a specified period, which are hotels in operation for at least 18 months as at the
beginning of one of the months within this period, the average RevPAR of these hotels in the months in which they are mature hotels within this period is compared
with the average RevPAR of these same hotels in the corresponding months of the prior year.
Financial Key Performance Indicators
Our financial key performance indicators consist of (i) revenues, (ii) operating costs and expenses and (iii) EBITDA (Non-GAAP) and Adjusted EBITDA (Non-GAAP).
Revenues. We primarily derive our revenues from operations of our leased and owned hotels and franchise and service fees from our manachised and franchised hotels.
The following table sets forth the revenues generated by our leased and owned as well as manachised and franchised hotels and other revenues, each in absolute amount
and as a percentage of total revenues for the periods indicated.

for the year. In 2021, we generated revenues of RMB8,118 million from our leased and owned hotels, which accounted for 63.5% of our total revenues for the year.
In 2022, we generated revenue of RMB9,148 million (US$1,326 million) from our leased and owned hotels, which accounted for 66.0% of our total revenues for the
year. We expect that revenues from our leased and owned hotels will continue to constitute a majority of our total revenues in the foreseeable future. As of
