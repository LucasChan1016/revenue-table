Impact of COVID-19 on Our Operations

The majority of our revenues are derived from sales of our vehicles in China. Our results of operations and financial condition have been affected by the spread of
COVID-19 since the first quarter of 2020. The COVID-19 pandemic has impact on China’s auto industry in general and the production and delivery of vehicles of our
company. Our operations experienced disruptions in 2020, 2021 and 2022, such as temporary closure of our offices and/or those of our customers or suppliers and
suspension of services, resulting in a reduction of vehicles manufactured and delivered, which affected our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash
flow. We worked closely with JAC, the joint manufacturer of our vehicles, to resume productions and minimize the impact of COVID-19 on our manufacturing capabilities. In
addition, we strived to expand our traffic channels, integrate our online and offline sales efforts and offer high-quality services to bring business and operation back to
normal.

There has been an easing of the travel restrictions and quarantine requirements related to COVID-19 in China since December 2022. However, there remains
uncertainty as to the future impact of the virus. The extent to which the pandemic impacts our results of operations going forward will depend on future developments
which are highly uncertain and unpredictable, including the frequency, duration and extent of outbreaks of COVID-19, the appearance of new variants with different
characteristics, the success or failure of efforts to contain or treat cases, and future actions we or the authorities may take in response to these developments. In addition,
our financial position, results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected to the extent that the pandemic harms the Chinese economy in general. As of
December 31, 2022, we had cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash and short-term investments of RMB42,212.8 million (US$6,120.3 million). We believe this level of
liquidity is sufficient to successfully navigate an extended period of uncertainty.

adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.”
