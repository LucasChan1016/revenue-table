The COVID-19 global pandemic has resulted in, and may intensify, global economic distress, and the duration and extent of the impact of COVID-19 outbreak is
highly uncertain at this time. We cannot guarantee you that the COVID-19 pandemic will not further escalate or have a material adverse effect on our results of operations,
financial condition, cash flows or prospects. China began to modify its zero-COVID policy at the end of 2022, and most of the travel restrictions and quarantine
requirements were lifted in December 2022. There were surges of cases in many cities during this time which caused disruption to our and our business partners’
operations, and there remains uncertainty as to the future impact of the virus, especially in light of this change in policy. The extent to which the pandemic impacts our
results of operations going forward will depend on future developments which are highly uncertain and unpredictable, including the frequency, duration and extent of
outbreaks of COVID-19, the appearance of new variants with different characteristics, the effectiveness of efforts to contain or treat cases, and future actions that may be
taken in response to these developments. China may experience lower domestic consumption, higher unemployment, severe disruptions to exporting of goods to other
countries and greater economic uncertainty, which may impact our business in a materially negative way. The financial services providers on our platform will need time to
recover from the economic effects of the pandemic even after business conditions begin to return to normal. Consequently, the COVID-19 pandemic may continue to
materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations in the current and future years.

We will pay close attention to the development of the COVID-19 pandemic, perform further assessment of its impact and take relevant measures to minimize the
impact. As of December 31, 2022, we had cash and cash equivalents, time deposits, restricted cash and time deposits of RMB684.2 million (US$99.2 million) and working
capital of approximately RMB371.3 million (US$53.8 million). For more details about the composition of our cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash and short-term
investments, please see “—B. Liquidity and Capital Resources.”

See “Item 3. Key Information—D. Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business—We face risks related to natural disasters, health epidemics and other outbreaks,
which could significantly disrupt our operations.”

Recommendation services.

We record fees charged for our recommendation services for credit card products on a cost-per-success basis, where the success is most often defined as the
issuance of a credit card and in other cases by the completion of an application or the first usage of a credit card, depending on the credit card issuer’s policy. Affected by
bank credit tightening and the impact of COVID-19 pandemic, revenue from recommendation of credit cards declined from 2019 to 2020. In both 2021 and 2022, revenue
from recommendation services for credit cards experienced recovery from the plunge in 2020.
