As of December 31, 2022, we had cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash of RMB456.7 million (US$66.2 million). We believe this
level of liquidity is sufficient to successfully navigate an extended period of uncertainty. See “Item 3. Key Information—D. Risk Factors—Risks
Related to Our Business and Industry—We face risks related to natural disasters, health epidemics and other outbreaks, which could
significantly disrupt our operations.”

Notes:

(1) | Starting from 2021, revenue from membership program is combined into other revenues and is no longer a separate revenue line.
Revenue breakdown for previous years presented in this annual report have been adjusted to be presented in the same manner.
Revenues generated from sales of most products on our platform are recorded as revenues from sale of merchandise, net of discounts,

coupons, referral incentives provided to members, return allowances and VAT. We acquire products from suppliers and sell them to users. For

our private label products, we acquire products from suppliers and sell them to users both on our platform and through external channels. We
expect revenues generated from sale of merchandise will continue to account for a majority of our total revenues.

In the first quarter of 2019, we launched our marketplace business, allowing third-party merchants to sell their products on the platform
and pay commissions on their sales to us. The revenues from the marketplace business are recognized on a net basis.

Other revenues include revenues from membership program and revenues earned on net basis from sales of certain products on our
platform, such as air tickets. We earn membership fees from our members, who pay a fixed fee in exchange for (1) a package of selected
products, (2) the right to receive member exclusive discounts for products sold on our flagship Yunji app, (3) access rights to our flagship Yunjj
app and its member-exclusive features, (4) the right to receive units of Yun-coin upon a successful new member referral, (5) member
exclusive training, and (6) certain units of Yun-coin. Yun-coin can only be used as credits when making purchases on our platform, with one
unit of Yun-coin representing RMB1.00. Yun-coins cannot be redeemed for cash. Members may transfer Yun-coins to others for free. In order
to stimulate our users’ interest in transacting on our platform and attract more members, starting in January 2020, we refined our membership
enrollment system by allowing any user to become a member and enjoy membership benefits free of charge for one year by simply registering
for an account on the Yunji app. If the user meets a certain cumulative spending threshold or certain other requirements during the initial
one-year period, the user may extend his or her membership for an extra year. As a result of the refinement of our membership enrollment
system in 2020, revenues from membership program in 2020 were from deferred revenue of prior paying members. We have ceased allowing
users to become members free of charge since April 1, 2021 and required new users and renewing members to pay an annual membership
fee to become or continue as a member and enjoy membership benefits until September 2022. Starting from October 2022, one can become
a member of our platform by accepting invitation from existing members, and continued membership eligibility will be contingent upon meeting
a certain cumulative spending threshold or certain other requirements. In addition, members who became members through purchasing a
membership package are now referred to as our diamond members and enjoy free lifelong membership and membership benefits. As a result,
during the period from April 1, 2021 to September 30, 2022, revenues from the membership program were from paying members who joined
the new membership program and during the period from October 1, 2022 to December 31, 2022, revenues from the membership program
