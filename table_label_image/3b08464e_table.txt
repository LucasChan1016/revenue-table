For the year ended December 31, 2022, our financial performance was materially and adversely affected as a result of the domestic and international travel restrictions
and significant incremental costs and expenses incurred to facilitate our customers’ cancellations and refund requests. Our net revenues for the year ended December 31,
2022 decreased by 57% from 2021.

China began to modify its zero-COVID policy at the end of 2022, and most of the travel restrictions and quarantine requirements were lifted in December 2022. There
were surges of cases in many cities during this time which caused disruptions to our, our business partners’ and travel suppliers’ operations, and there remains uncertainty
as to the future impact of the virus, especially in light of this change in policy. The extent of the impact of the COVID 19 pandemic on our business and financial results will
depend largely on future developments, including the duration and extent of the spread of COVID 19 around the world, and the prevalence of local, national and
international travel restrictions which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted. China may experience lower domestic consumption, higher unemployment, severe
disruptions to exporting of goods to other countries and greater economic uncertainty, which may materially impact our business in a negative way, as demand for leisure
travel drops and we incur incremental costs in response to travelers’ cancellations and refund requests. Consequently, the COVID-19 pandemic may continue to materially
and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations in the current and future years. As the COVID 19 pandemic is still evolving, we will continue
to monitor and evaluate the financial impacts to our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows and make adjustments accordingly.

and cash flows have been and may continue to be materially and adversely affected by the COVID -19 outbreak and spread.”

Any future outbreak of contagious diseases or similar adverse public health developments, extreme unexpected bad weather, or severe natural disasters would affect
our business and operating results. Ongoing concerns regarding contagious disease or natural disasters, particularly its effect on travel, could adversely affect our users’
desire to travel. If there is a recurrence of an outbreak of certain contagious diseases or natural disasters, travel to and from affected regions could be curtailed. Public
policy regarding, or governmental restrictions on, travel to and from these and other regions on account of an outbreak of any contagious disease or occurrence of natural
disasters could materially and adversely affect our business and operating results.
