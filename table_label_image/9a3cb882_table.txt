We delivered our first passenger-carrying AAV to a customer in March 2018. Since then, we and the VIE had delivered 185 units of the
EH216 series AAVs as of December 31, 2022. As we continue to refine and commercialize our AAVs and air mobility solutions, we believe we
will be able to capture addressable markets across multiple industries and develop AAV commercial applications in new industries.

Our revenues decreased by 68.5% from RMB180.1 million in 2020 to RMB56.8 million in 2021, and decreased by 22% to
RMB44.3 million (US$6.4 million) in 2022. Our net loss increased by 241.0% from RMB92.0 million in 2020 to RMB313.9 million in 2021, and
increased by 4.9% to RMB329.3 million (US$47.7 million) in 2022. In 2022, revenues generated by air mobility solutions, smart city
management solutions and aerial media solutions were RMB40.4 million (US$5.9 million), RMB2.1 million (US$0.3 million) and
RMB1.3 million (US$0.2 million), representing 91.2%, 4.8% and 3.0% of our total revenues, respectively.

Air mobility solutions. Revenues from air mobility solutions consist of revenues from (i) sales of the EH216 series AAVs and (ii) provision
of logistics services. Revenues from sales of the EH216 series AAVs are based on firm customer orders with fixed terms and conditions,
including pricing, net of discounts, if any. The performance obligation under the contract is the delivery of AAVs, which is satisfied at a point in
time, in general upon our receipt of acknowledgement receipts from customers or under some circumstances upon the AAVs have been
shipped to the contractually agreed location when the products are sold to customers outside PRC. Our revenues from air mobility solutions in
2022 were mainly derived from sales of the EH216 series AAVs to customers mainly operated on a limited trial basis in tourism locations in
China for testing, training and demonstration purposes. Before regulatory approvals for the commercial operations of our AAVs have been
obtained in China and/or other relevant jurisdictions, customer demand will likely be limited in volume. Currently we are working to obtain such
approvals in China. However, we are unable to predict the timing of such approvals.

Smart city management solutions. Smart city management solutions mainly include (i) design and development of command-and-control
systems and related facilities, and (ii) sale of AAVs and other related products. For design and development of command-and-control systems
and related facilities, we recognize revenues using a percentage of completion method. We typically enter into project contracts with
customers, according to which they pay project fees based on the agreed schedule. As we provide smart city management solutions on a
project basis with high individual transaction values, revenues from smart city management solutions may be more concentrated in certain
years or periods, and therefore are subject to greater period-to-period fluctuations.
