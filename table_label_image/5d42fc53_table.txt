Cost of Revenues

Our cost of revenues from continuing operations related to tuition fees from kindergartens, student care centers and play-and-learn centers
consists primarily of all costs and expenses in the operation of all of our directly operated facilities. Such costs and expenses primarily include (i)
compensation to facility staff, (ii) facility rental cost, (iii) food and supplies cost, (iv) all other costs and expenses incurred to run and maintain our
facilities and (v) depreciation and amortization. Compensation to our facility staff consists of base salaries, performance-based bonuses and share-based
and other compensation to them. Facility staff mainly includes principals and other managers of our teaching facilities, teachers, nursery aides and
administrative staff. Most of our facility staff are our own employees. We normally assign two teachers and one nursery aide to each kindergarten class.
Our food and supplies cost represents the cost of the raw ingredients for the meals and cost of raw materials for the educational products we provide at
our directly operated teaching facilities. We expect our facility staff cost and ingredient and raw material cost to be in line with the size of our business.
We expect the amount of our facility rental cost to continue to increase as we grow. Our depreciation and amortization cost relates to the depreciation
charges of the furniture, fixtures and equipment used in rendering teaching services, the leasehold improvement for our teaching facilities, and
amortization charges of the acquired intangible assets. As we further expand our directly operated facilities network, we expect such cost to increase in
absolute amounts.

Our cost of revenues relating to our franchise fees from continuing operations mainly consists of compensation to our franchise service and
supervision team members for (i) the signing and onboarding of new franchisees, (ii) the support and services to franchisees for their facility
establishment, marketing and operation optimization and (iii) ongoing quality supervision. As we continue to expand our franchise network and employ
more staff for our franchise service and supervision team, we expect the franchisee support and service cost to increase in absolute amounts.

Our cost of revenues relating to our teaching and management services mainly consists of (i) compensation to facility staff, (ii) merchandise cost
and (iii) course research and development cost. As we continue to expand our teaching and management service, we expect to increase our expense in
course research and development cost.

Our cost of revenues relating to our training and other services mainly consists of compensation to facility staff, facility rental cost and all other
costs and expenses relating to training services.

Our cost of revenues relating to our royalty fees from continuing operations mainly consists of compensation to facility staff, merchandise cost and
facility rental cost.
