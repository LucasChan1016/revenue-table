Concession fees constituted a significant portion of our cost of revenues. Concession fees tend to increase over time, and a significant increase in concession fees will
increase our cost while our revenues may not increase proportionately, or at all. Therefore, it will be important to our results of operations that we secure and retain these
concession rights contracts on commercially advantageous terms.
Important Factors Affecting the Results of Operations of Our Cryptocurrency Mining Business
The value of cryptocurrencies is determined by market factors, supply of and demand for the units, the prices being set in transfers by mutual agreement or barter among
transacting parties, as well as the number of merchants that may accept the cryptocurrency. Units of cryptocurrency can be converted to fiat currencies, such as the U.S.
dollar, at rates determined on Coinbase and various other exchanges. Cryptocurrency prices are quoted on various exchanges and fluctuate with extreme volatility.
To mine cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, specialized computer servers (known as “miners”) need to be acquired and deployed at-scale to support
blockchain in exchange of rewards in the form of cryptocurrencies. Given the sophistications as well as quantity on demand, the miners can only be built by a few
manufacturers with required technological specialties and manufacturing capabilities. Hence, miners are continuously in short supplies and a premium over the listed retail
price is required to secure a purchase of miners in significant quantities.
Recent Developments
We plan to restructure our business in 2023 by selling our air travel media network business to Mr. Man Guo, our chairman and interim chief financial officer, and will then

report.
