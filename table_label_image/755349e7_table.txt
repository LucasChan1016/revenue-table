(0) Revenue
On January 1, 2018, the Group adopted ASC 606, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers” using the modified retrospective method
applied to those contracts which were not completed as of January 1, 2018. Results for reporting periods beginning after January 1,
2018 are presented under Topic 606, while prior period amounts are not adjusted and continue to be reported in accordance with the
Company’s historic accounting under Topic 605. Based on the Company’s assessment, the adoption of ASC 606 did not have any
material impact to the Group’s consolidated financial statements and there were no material differences between the Company’s
adoption of ASC 606 and its historic accounting under ASC 605.
Revenues are recognized when control of the promised virtual items or services is transferred to the Group’s customers, in an amount
that reflects the consideration the Group expects to be entitled to in exchange for those virtual items or services. The following table
disaggregates the Group’s revenue by major type for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2021 and 2022:

Revenue recognition and significant judgments
(i) Live streaming
The Group is principally engaged in operating its own live streaming platforms, which enable broadcasters and viewers to interact with
each other during live streaming. It generates revenue primarily from sales of virtual items in the platforms. The Group has a recharge
system for users to purchase the Group’s virtual currency, which can then be utilised to purchase virtual items for use on the live
streaming platforms. Users can recharge via various online payment platforms, including WeChat Pay, AliPay and other payment
platforms. Virtual currency is non-refundable and without expiry. As the virtual currency is often consumed soon after it is purchased
based on history of turnover of the virtual currency, the Group considers it does not expect to be entitled to a breakage amount for the
virtual currency. Unconsumed virtual currency is recorded as deferred revenue. Virtual currencies used to purchase virtual items are
recognized as revenue according to the prescribed revenue recognition policies of virtual items addressed below unless otherwise
stated. The Group shares a portion of the sales proceeds of virtual items (“revenue sharing fee”) with broadcasters and talent agencies
which recruit and manage broadcasters in accordance with their revenue sharing arrangements.
The Group evaluates and determines that it is the principal and views users to be its customers in the revenue generating arrangement
and the Group reports live streaming revenues on a gross basis. Accordingly, the amounts billed to users are recorded as revenues and
revenue sharing fee paid/payable to broadcasters and talent agencies are recorded as cost of revenues. Where the Group is the
principal, it controls the virtual items before they are transferred to users. Its control is evidenced by the Group’s sole ability to monetize
the virtual items before they are transferred to users, and is further supported by the Group being primarily responsible to users and
having a level of discretion in establishing pricing.
