Our non-financial key performance indicators consist of increase in the total number of hotels and hotel rooms in our hotel network, as well as RevPAR achieved by our
leased-and-operated hotels and franchised-and-managed hotels. RevPAR is a commonly used operating measure in the hospitality industry and is defined as the product of
average occupancy rates and average daily rates achieved. Occupancy rates of our hotels mainly depend on the locations of our hotels, product and service offering, the
effectiveness of our sales and brand promotion efforts, our ability to effectively manage hotel reservations, the performance of managerial and other employees of our
hotels, as well as our ability to respond to competitive pressure. We set the room rates of our hotels primarily based on the location of hotels, room rates charged by our
competitors within the same locality, and our relative brand and product strength in the city or city cluster.

Our financial key performance indicators consist of revenues, operating costs and expenses, which are discussed in greater detail in the following paragraphs.
Revenues

We primarily derive our revenues from operation of our leased-and-operated hotels and various types of fees we charge our franchisees in relation to our franchised-
and-managed hotels. We also generate revenue from the one-time membership fees charged to our hotel guests. Our revenues are net of a value-added tax of 6% and other
related taxes. The following table sets forth our revenues generated by our franchised-and-managed hotels and leased-and-operated hotels, both in absolute amount and as
a percentage of total revenues for the year indicated.

@ Franchised-and-managed Hotels. In 2020, 2021 and 2022, we generated revenues of RMB677.5 million, RMB774.4 million and RMB582.4 million (US$84.4 million) from

our franchised-and-managed hotels, which accounted for 72.9%, 64.2% and 62.2% of our revenues for the respective years, which include revenues from membership

fees of franchised-and-managed hotels.

We select franchisees who are property owners, existing hotel operators or hotel investors. We train and manage general managers for our franchised-and-managed
hotels and impose the same standards on all franchised-and-managed hotels to ensure product quality and consistency across our hotel network. Pursuant to the franchise-
and-management agreements, we charge the franchisees fixed hotel manager fees to compensate us for the franchised-and-managed hotel managersâ€™ salaries, social
welfare benefits and certain other out-of-pocket expenses as incurred. The hotel manager fee is recognized as revenue on a monthly basis. Management services we
provide to our franchisees generally include appointing and training hotel managers, obtaining access to and integrating into our central reservation system and our
proprietary IT system, providing sales and marketing support, conducting quality assurance inspections, and providing other operational support and information. Our
franchisees are responsible for operating expenses and the costs of developing and operating the hotels, including renovating the hotels according to our standards. We
believe that our franchised-and-managed model has enabled us to quickly and effectively expand our geographical coverage and increase our market share in an asset-light
manner by utilizing the local knowledge and relationships of our franchisees and the properties that they may own or have access to which are suitable for future hotel
business cooperation with us.
